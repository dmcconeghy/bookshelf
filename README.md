# bookshelf

As a former teacher, I have a extensive library. Books and more books! 
As a software development project, I thought it would be fun to create a library web app. 
A future feature I'm excited about is ISBN scanning, since I'm trying to do more IOT projects. 

This project was made using Python, Flask, PSQL, Html, CSS and JavaScript.
